          <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
          <br></br>
          <p>To encourage people to recognise their privileges and take action to assist the underprivileged. We want you to help us in opening a window of opportunity for those in need.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2>WHY DOES IT MATTER</h2>
          <br></br>
            <p>There is a significant gap in resource accessibility between developed and underdeveloped areas, which is preventing underdeveloped regions from growing and developing. Even today, there are places where
            Children are not properly educated, living conditions are deplorable, and child marriages continue to occur.<br></br>
    
            Because of a lack of awareness and education, many stereotypes and myths persist. Lack of health care reduces life expectancy, and poor working conditions increase the risk of exploitation. Because they are unaware and uneducated, they are duped by those with self-interest and coaxed into slavery and trafficking.People living in underdeveloped areas have every right to live a peaceful and comfortable life; they deserve better. The children have the right to have a dream.</p>
