       <p>Namaste, My name is Sania Kalmodia, and this website is a part of my Summer Immersion Program learning project with Girlswhocode. I created this website to raise awareness about the issue that I am most passionate about: the scarcity of essential resources in underdeveloped areas. When I visit my grandparents in their village, I am deeply concerned by what I see. The school in the village is very small, with no teaching equipment and no qualified teachers; most of the girls drop out because they are told that learning household work and getting married should be their priority; the minimum wage for workers in the village is very low; and they are trapped in a toxic cycle of discrimination and violence due to a lack of education and awareness. 
         <br></br>
         When I see children who should be learning, playing, and dreaming with the burden of discrimination, labour, and persistent poverty in their eyes, it makes me wonder why.?Â I've been seeing that village for the past 18 years and nothing has changed. Why is it taking so long for development to reach there? It's not just this village; there are many more around the world where the light of development hasn't yet reached because they lack access to the most basic resources. </p>
